"[...] Java has anonymous classes, which serve some of the purposes of closures, although in a less versatile way with a more clumsy syntax. In Lisp, we can say \texttt{(lambda (x) (f (g x)))} where in Java we would have to say

\begin{verbatim}

new UnaryFunction() { 
  public Object execute(Object x) {
    return (Cast x).g().f();
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
where Cast is the real type of x. This would only work with classes that observe the UnaryFunction interface (which comes from JGL and is not built-in to Java). [...]"
