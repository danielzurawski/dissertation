\section{Testing}
In order to ensure that the compiler is naturally expanded and a sufficient amount of regression tests is performed whenever a new language construct is added, I have decided to use the Test Driven Development methodology. 

\subsection{clojure.test API}
The tool to support me in the task of TDD I used was the clojure.test API.
clojure.test API [REFERENCE HERE] is a unit testing framework that provides a set of in-built forms, particularly the "is" macro that allows to perform boolean assertions on arbitrary expressions.

(deftest factorial-example
  (is (= "function factorial(n) {if(n<2) { return 1 } else { return (n*factorial(((n-1)))) }}"
         (lisp-to-js (defn factorial [n] (if (< n 2) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

.Although the compiler is not a very complexy system, it still
