\chapter{Results/Evaluation}
The implementation of Lispish to JavaScript was supposed to serve as an example of how in a simple way, a programming language translator can be implemented.

Appendix [REFERENCE HERE] provides a set of unit tests that include three real applications of our translator by trans-compiling a Clojure Fibonacci, factorial and Ackermann functions to its equivalent JavaScript functions.

The test suite defined in the test namespace all successfully pass. 

The compiler does not provide any facility for error reporting during compilation and for checking the validity of the Lispish source code, nor the generated JavaScript code.
