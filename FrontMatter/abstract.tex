To those familiar with JavaScript, there is a widely spread opinion that the language itself although very powerful and extensible, contains many quirks and can be difficult to master. It is, however, present on most (if not all) modern Internet-enabled devices and can be used as a target language for compilers of other languages for the sole purpose of making them portable. 

This paper is going to define a new language \texttt{Lispish}, which is going to be a subset language of Clojure, a modern dialect of Lisp. It will also propose a way in which Lispish can be translated to JavaScript.
