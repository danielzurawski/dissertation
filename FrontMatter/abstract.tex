To those familiar with JavaScript, there is a wide spread opinion that the language itself although very powerful and extensible, contains many quirks and can be difficult to master, it is however present on all of the modern Internet-enabled computers and can be used as a target language for compilers of other languages for the sole purpose of making them portable.
