\chapter{Introduction}
"This is one of the most important components of the report. It should begin with a clear statement of what the project is about so that the nature and scope of the project can be understood by a lay reader. It should summarise everything that you set out to achieve, provide a clear summary of the project's background and relevance to other work, and give pointers to the remaining sections of the report, which will contain the bulk of the technical material"  .... \\
With the uprise of high performance JavaScript compilers such as the Google V8 JavaScript Engine, raised the interest in creating programming language translator (compilers or in other words trans-compilers) from a different source programming language to JavaScript, thus making it portable as JavaScript can be run in any modern web browser. On the other hand, the Lisp family of programming languages offers a simplistic and elegant, yet powerful syntax based on parenthesised lists and expressions written in the prefix notation (Polish notation). I will investigate how such translation is performed and implement a simple compiler that can translate a subset of Lisp to JavaScript, using a Clojure programming language, which is a modern dialect of Lisp running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). \\
The wide adoption of the web over the recent years and the increasing interest in building Rich Internet Applications (RIA) resulted in big companies offering Software as a Service solution in the form of web applications, notably application from the Google Apps family, including Gmail, Google Calendar and Talk. To support development of such applications raised the need to support different programming paradigms and therefore compilers or in other words trans-compilers that could convert a source language (e.g. Java) into an optimised JavaScript code, here notably GWT (Google Web Toolkit). It was necessary to improve the efficiency of JavaScript interpreters and as a result tools such as the Google V8 JavaScript Engine [reference here] that compiles a platform independent JavaScript directly to machine code vastly improving the attractiveness of JavaScript. Shortly after that communities of different programming languages started to develop similar compilers from different source languages that could compile to the same JavaScript in order to make their code portable.
The main motivation behind this project is to investigate how compilers and interpreters for functional languages work and how a translation from a source (Lisp) language to a target (JavaScript) can be performed. The implementation language I am planning to use is Clojure. This project offers a good opportunity to deepen understanding of functional programming and JavaScript and how both can be used to solve complex problems in Computer Science. The end result of this project is going to be a simple Lisp to JavaScript compiler, that given an input string (Lisp program) will be able to produce a plug and play executable JavaScript, that can be later executed.
