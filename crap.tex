The wide adoption of the web over the recent years and the increasing interest in building Rich Internet Applications (RIA) resulted in big companies offering Software as a Service solution in the form of web applications, notably application from the Google Apps family, including Gmail, Google Calendar and Talk. To support development of such applications raised the need to support different programming paradigms and therefore compilers or in other words trans-compilers that could convert a source language (e.g. Java) into an optimised JavaScript code, here notably GWT (Google Web Toolkit). It was necessary to improve the efficiency of JavaScript interpreters and as a result tools such as the Google V8 JavaScript Engine [reference here] that compiles a platform independent JavaScript directly to machine code vastly improving the attractiveness of JavaScript. Shortly after that communities of different programming languages started to develop similar compilers from different source languages that could compile to the same JavaScript in order to make their code portable.
